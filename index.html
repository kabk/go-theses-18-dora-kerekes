        <h2>The flood is coming</h2>
        <h2>Order tends to disorder</h2>
        <h2>Thanks Adam and Eve</h2>
        <p>I am researching biblical archetypal stories, the story of Adam and Eve and the story of the Flood in particular. The former is a creation story, the latter is the opposite. I want to find out why are we so unconsciously attracted to these biblical myths, how are they depicted in popular culture such as fiction movies, what are the common biblical elements that usually come back in them and how do they reflect on our every day lives. I believe that the biblical stories are true, but not in the same way as scientific truth is true. I think they are could be interpreted as meta-stories of human nature and culture, and that’s precisely the reason why its elements keep coming back in popular culture, because they teach us about ourselves. It might happen in a very subtle and unconscious way.As a graphic designer I’m fascinated by the impact that the Bible had on our Western civilisation, although I feel it’s a very controversial topic that is not discussed much. People tend to ignore this subject because of some extremely rigid believers who take every word literally. I would like to keep and open minded approach by analysing it from a non-religious perspective, treating it more like a piece of literature. I’ve started off using sources from the internet, luckily there are many valuable interviews lectures and articles online. Through those, I’ve collected a list of books that are currently unavailable to me, I hope to find a way to access them soon. (An access to JSTOR would be great) When I started researching my knowledge was very basic and almost equal to zero. One of the unexpected things I found out how biblical motives come back in popular culture — usually the ones that get the most attention for example the Narnia, The Lion King and Harry Potter. Honestly, it’s hard to answer this question, I’m looking for unexpected things outside of what I currently know. </p>
